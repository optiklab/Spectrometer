# Spectrometer
Spectrometer is a software written on .NET C# for Windows which allows you to analyze light spectrum in hardware limits of your web camera. 

## What can it be used for?
It is an example of very simple application for light analysis. It cannot be used without appropriate hardware developed by my friend,
but it still works with any USB camera and you can do fun things by simply compile and run it. Also you can use my code to create
a new application for your own needs.


It was made for Laser Light analysis, that is why it needs to be connected with right hardware, which works via standard web camera interface,
but have some differences in light perception.
